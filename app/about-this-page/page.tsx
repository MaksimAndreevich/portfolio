      My web application, built on Next.js version 14, serves as a platform to
      showcase personal information and several of my pet projects. Leveraging
      cutting-edge technologies, including MobX for efficient state management,
      TypeScript version 5 for added static typing, Inversify JS for effective
      dependency injection, and Material-UI for crafting a modern and stylish
      user interface, the application ensures seamless interaction with the
      content. This technology stack not only ensures high performance but also
      facilitates development convenience, making the application scalable and
      easily maintainable
