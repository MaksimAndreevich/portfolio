        My application is crafted on Next.js version 14, leveraging server-side
        rendering (SSR). It incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as
        TypeScript (TS), MobX for state management, Material-UI (MUI), and
        utilizes PostgreSQL as its database. The app boasts a seamless theme
        switcher, allowing users to effortlessly toggle between dark and light
        modes. With a user-friendly left navigation panel and responsive design
        tailored for mobile devices, there's a lot more to explore. Below, I'll
        delve into the intricacies of each mini-project within this application.
        Enjoy your journey! I'd be delighted if you come across any bugs and
        take a moment to share them with me in the issues. I have confidence
        that you'll manage it splendidly!
